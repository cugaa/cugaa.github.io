        <p>After 20 years of Hollywood Dogs and 5 shops we are excited to announce that we are now working from our home salon at our farm in Old Warden Bedfordshire. This move will enable us to give your dogs an even more personal and relaxed grooming experience! We will be working on a strictly appointment only basis so please call or email to make your appointment, we look forward to welcoming you! </p>
        <p>Is it just me or does it feel like the winter went on forever! Bring on the Summer of 2023, as I write this looking out of the salon window the sun is shining and the baby lambs are having fun in the field! So uplifting!

            It is the season for shorter haircuts, hot dogs and the dreaded grass seeds! So if you have a Cocker or a Cockapoo in particular check between their toes after walks, as grass seeds can be a very painful and expensive vet visit, these pesky things can and do travel, ouch!
            
            Appointment updates, we are still taking on new clients although I am not able to groom big and hairy breeds like German Shepherds etc but if you get in touch, I organise our local network of groomers and I can always find you someone who is a perfect fit for your dog and more than happy to offer advice too!
            
            Have a wonderful summer with your dogs and I can‚Äôt wait to see them!

            Well Summer should be here by now, the heat may not have arrived but all the Summer puppies certainly have! We have had so many squishy puppies lately that we have been totally spoilt. It‚Äôs been hard to socialise your pups through lockdown so it‚Äôs really important that they pop over and say Hi to meet us, plus we are always up for puppy cuddles! The more people your pup meets out and about the better so that they are confident and happy to be left for grooming, vet visits or to stay with friends or relatives. One question we get asked a lot is how your puppy will cope when being dropped off at the salon what you can do to help them?
            
            The best way to deal with this I have found is just for you to be confident for them and have a no fuss attitude when you leave them, then they know from you (mum or dad) that everything is going to be ok and there is nothing for them to worry about. Once you have left there is so much going on that they are happy and curious to see everything thats going on and we will make it a fun time for them!
            
            Plus they get to be super excited to see you again and show off their super new haircut!
            
            Hope this helps!
            
            Take Care Rachel

            January Lockdown announcement Dog Grooming has been included in the businesses that are permitted to open as we are deemed to be essential for animal welfare so the salon is open from Wednesdays through to Saturdays, all appointments will be going ahead as usual and we are currently accepting new clients. We do ask that you wear a face covering when you drop off your dog and please stay at home if you or anyone in your family are experiencing symptoms or have been tested positive for Covid 19 to keep us all safe.
            
            We are operating a completely no contact and socially distanced drop off procedure you may leave your dogs lead with us as they will be sanitised. We totally understand if you would like to change your appointment due to illness/isolation or shielding just let us know and we will work around you.
            
            Best Wishes to you all and stay safe.
